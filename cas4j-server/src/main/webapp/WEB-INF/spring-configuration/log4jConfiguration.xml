        Log4J initialization.  Configuration options are sourced from cas.properties.  This allows deployers to externalize
        both cas.properties and log4j.xml, so that a single cas.war file can be deployed to multiple tiers or hosts without
        having to do any post configuration.  This approach helps to preserve configuration between upgrades.

        Deployers should not have to edit this file.
